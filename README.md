<strong>This is a simple application of the blockchain technology. with some basic functionalities:</strong>
<br> 

**One**

The withdraw function allows users to withdraw ether from their account
<br>


**two**


It requires that the amount to withdraw is greater than zero,
does not exceed 90% of the your available balance(click the balance button to check balance),
that you have sufficient balance,
and that you have not made more than 4 withdrawals in the current day.


<br>

The function subtracts the amount withdrawn from the your balance, transfers the ether to the your address, updates the number of withdrawals made by the your today, and emits a Withdrawal event.
